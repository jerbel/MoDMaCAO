## Overal Architecture
The overall architecture is shown below:

## The MoDMaCAO modeling framework
The MoDMaCAO modeling framework is
based on OCCIware and allows cloud architects to: 
1.  design abstract types modeling cloud applications  and  their  components, 
2.  model  configured instances of cloud applications that use the defined abstract types, and 
3.  check the validity of instances of cloud applications.

## The MoDMaCAO implementation framework

## Example Use cases
The repository contains several examples that have been modelled with help of MoDMaCAO: a model
for a distributed MongoDB, a model for a the popular LAMP stack, a model for the Apache
Cassandra database, and a model for an Apache Spark cluster.
